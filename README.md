# TKLittle
My first custom keyboard layout, fully designed and created by me just as a fun learning experience.

The name TKLittle comes from the layout, inspiered by my 2 favorite layouts: Tkl and 40%(with a little opional HHKB-like bottom row thrown into in).

The pcb is made in Kicad 6 using the Klepcbgen by Jeroen Bouwens as a starting point, but with a pro micro insted of an intecrated chip.

Bottom layer, will be 3mm think in clear acrylic to show the bottom silkscreen of the pcb

Middle layer, 5mm thick frosted acrylic, with cutout wide enough to fit the pro micro so its closer to the edge so that it can use different cables easily

Top plate,5mm thick frosted acrylic with HHKB blockers.

The case should be mounted with 6 M2x18 bolts with nuts at the end, and for feen im gonna put some silicon feet instead of acyllic.

As i've said this is just a fun project, but i would like to learn from is it so i would if anyone with a bit more experience could give me some feedback on it before i spend the money to turn it into a reality
I have experience hand wiring multiple boards and ive made my own 3d printed cases before, so i kinda know what im doing, but its my first time working with Kicad so this is what im most worried about.
